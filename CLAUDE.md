# FortigiGraph - AI Assistant Development Guide

> **IMPORTANT: After making ANY code changes, you MUST add a changelog fragment!**
> 1. Create or update `changes/<branch-name>.md` (e.g. `changes/fix-mssql-shim-boolean.md`) with bullet points describing the functional change (user-facing language, not implementation details).
> 2. Do **NOT** edit `CHANGES.md` directly — the `bump-version.yml` Action merges all fragments into it on PR merge.
> 3. Do **NOT** edit `ModuleVersion` in `setup/IdentityAtlas.psd1` — version bumps are also automated by the same Action.

## Project Overview

Identity Atlas is a Docker-deployed application that pulls authorization data from Microsoft Graph (and other systems via CSV) into a **PostgreSQL** database, then surfaces it through a React role-mining UI. The worker container ships PowerShell crawler scripts; all persistence flows through the Node.js API.

**Key Information:**
- **Languages:** PowerShell (crawlers), JavaScript (Node API + React UI), SQL (postgres migrations)
- **Stack:** PostgreSQL 16 + Node.js API (port 3001) + PowerShell worker — all in Docker
- **Author:** Wim van den Heijkant / Fortigi — https://github.com/Fortigi/IdentityAtlas
- **Current Version:** 5.x.yyyyMMdd.HHmm (auto-bumped by `bump-version.yml` on every PR merge to `main`)

**Subdirectory coding guides (loaded contextually):**
- `Functions/CLAUDE.md` — PowerShell function conventions, patterns, Graph API permissions
- `app/api/CLAUDE.md` — Node.js API conventions, testing, migrations
- `app/ui/CLAUDE.md` — React/UI conventions, dark mode, shared utilities

**Architecture docs:** `docs/architecture/` contains postgres-migration, context-redesign, entity-detail-pages, llm-and-risk-scoring, docker-setup, csv-import-schema.

## Branching & Versioning Strategy

> **These are hard rules. Always follow them exactly.**

### Branch Model

| Branch | Purpose | PR required? | Approval required? |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `main` | Integration trunk. Never commit directly. Merges push `:edge` Docker tag. | Yes | Yes (at least 1) |
| `feature/<name>` | All feature work. Created from `main`. Merged back to `main` via PR. | Yes (to `main`) | No |
| `bugfixes/<name>` | Bug fixes. Branch from `main` for pre-release fixes; branch from a **release tag** for hotfixes. | Yes (to `main`) | No |

**Rules:**
- `feature/` branches must be branched off `main`.
- `bugfixes/` branches branch from `main` for pre-release fixes. For hotfixes to an already-released version, branch from the release tag: `git checkout -b bugfixes/fix-foo v5.2.0`.
- Hotfix commits must be cherry-picked back to `main` via a separate PR so the fix is included in future releases.
- All merges go through a Pull Request — no direct pushes to `main` ever.
- Branch names: `feature/<short-descriptive-name>` or `bugfixes/<short-descriptive-name>` (lowercase, hyphens).
- When starting work, always create a new branch. Never work directly on `main`.
- **One issue per branch.** Each branch must fix exactly one issue or implement exactly one feature.

### Version Number Scheme

| Context | Version format | Example | Docker tag pushed |
|---------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| `main` dev builds | `Major.Minor.yyyyMMdd.HHmm` | `5.3.20260419.1430` | `:edge` |
| Release tags (`v*`) | `Major.Minor.Patch.0` | `5.2.1.0` | `:latest` |
| `feature/*` / `bugfixes/*` | — | — | Nobody |

**Who updates versions:**

| Context | Who updates it | When |
|---------|---------------|------|
| `main` dev builds | `bump-version.yml` (automated) | Every PR merge — increments `Minor`, updates timestamp |
| Release tags | `cut-release.yml` / `cut-hotfix.yml` (automated) | When you run Actions → Cut Release or Cut Hotfix |
| `feature/*` / `bugfixes/*` | **Nobody** | Never touch `setup/IdentityAtlas.psd1` on a branch |

### Changelog Fragments

Every feature/bugfixes branch must add a fragment file under `changes/`. **Never edit `CHANGES.md` directly.**

- **Filename:** `changes/<descriptive-name>.md` — use the branch name or a short slug. One file per branch is typical.
- **Content:** Bullet points only. User-facing language. No implementation details.

**Fragment format:**
```markdown
- <Functional description of change 1>
- <Functional description of change 2>
```

**Rules:**
- Write in user-facing language ("Added X", "Fixed Y", "Improved Z").
- Do not describe internal refactors unless they affect observable behavior.
- Add a bullet immediately after each meaningful change — don't batch them up at the end.

## Data Model

### Universal Data Model (v3.1)

The data model supports importing authorization data from any system. Resources, ResourceAssignments, and ResourceRelationships are also used for governance data (business roles, governed assignments, resource grants).

```
                                    ┌──────────┐
                                    │ Systems  │
                                    └────┬─────┘
                         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
                         │               │               │
                    ┌────▼────┐    ┌─────▼─────┐   ┌─────▼─────┐
                    │Resources│    │Principals │   │ OrgUnits  │
                    └────┬────┘    └─────┬─────┘   └───────────┘
                         │               │               ▲
                    ┌────▼────────┐      │          orgUnitId
                    │Resource     │◄─────┘         ┌─────┴─────┐
                    │Assignments  │  principalId   │Identities │
                    └─────────────┘                └─────┬─────┘
                         │                         ┌─────▼──────┐
                    ┌────▼────────┐                │Identity    │
                    │Resource     │                │Members     │
                    │Relationships│                └────────────┘
                    └─────────────┘
```

**Tables:**
- **Systems** — Connected authorization sources (EntraID, SharePoint, AzureRM, DevOps, etc.)
- **Resources** — Any permission-granting resource (groups, roles, app roles, sites) **and** business roles (`resourceType='BusinessRole'`) with `extendedAttributes` JSON
- **ResourceAssignments** — Who has access to what (`resourceId` + `principalId` + `assignmentType`). Governed assignments use `assignmentType='Governed'`
- **ResourceRelationships** — Resource-to-resource links (`Contains`, `GrantsAccessTo`). Business role resource grants use `relationshipType='Contains'`
- **Principals** — User accounts from any system with `principalType` and `extendedAttributes` JSON
- **Identities** — Real persons aggregated from multiple accounts (account correlation)
- **IdentityMembers** — Links identities to their principals across systems

**Core + JSON pattern:** Frequently-queried attributes are real SQL columns; system-specific attributes live in `extendedAttributes` JSON.

**Backward compatibility:** All queries prefer new tables (Resources, Principals) with automatic fallback to legacy tables (GraphGroups, GraphUsers).

### Contexts (v6, April 2026)

Contexts are a unified data surface. Single `Contexts` table with three variants (synced / generated / manual) and four target types (Identity / Resource / Principal / System). Membership lives in `ContextMembers`.

Legacy tables — `OrgUnits`, `GraphResourceClusters`, `GraphResourceClusterMembers`, `Identities.contextId`, `GraphTags`, `GraphTagAssignments` — are gone. Tags are now `contextType='Tag'` Contexts (with backward-compat views). Clustering, org-chart derivation, tags, and business processes are all context-algorithm plugins that register at startup and emit generated Contexts.

See `docs/architecture/context-redesign.md` for the design.

### Governance Model (v3.1 — Unified)

Business roles, certifications, and access policies from any IGA platform. Business roles and their assignments/resource grants are stored in the shared Resources, ResourceAssignments, and ResourceRelationships tables.

**Governance-specific tables:** GovernanceCatalogs, AssignmentPolicies, AssignmentRequests, CertificationDecisions.

**IGA platform mapping:**

| Table | Column Filter | Entra ID | Omada | SailPoint |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------|-----------|
| GovernanceCatalogs | — | Catalog | — | Source |
| Resources | `resourceType='BusinessRole'` | Access Package | Business Role | Access Profile |
| ResourceRelationships | `relationshipType='Contains'` | Resource Role Scopes | Role Entitlements | Entitlements |
| ResourceAssignments | `assignmentType='Governed'` | AP Assignment | Role Assignment | Access Request Result |
| AssignmentPolicies | — | AP Assignment Policy | Assignment Policy | Access Request Config |
| AssignmentRequests | — | AP Assignment Request | — | Access Request |
| CertificationDecisions | — | AP Access Review | CRA | Certification |

## Repository Setup (One-Time)

### GitHub Actions Secrets

| Secret | Required scopes | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `VERSION_BUMP_PAT` | `repo` (includes `contents:write`) | Lets `bump-version.yml`, `cut-release.yml`, and `cut-hotfix.yml` push tags and commits to `main`. |

### Branch Protection

Run once after repo creation (requires `gh` CLI authenticated as admin):

```bash
bash tools/setup-branch-protection.sh Fortigi/IdentityAtlas
```

This sets: `main` — PR required (1 approval), `PR Summary` check required, admins bypass.

---

## Development Workflow

### Starting New Work

**Feature (not yet released):**
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feature/<name>
```

**Pre-release bugfix:**
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b bugfixes/<name>
```

**Hotfix (bug in a released version):**
```bash
git checkout -b bugfixes/<name> v5.2.0   # branch from the release tag, NOT main
git push origin bugfixes/<name>
# Then run Actions → Cut Hotfix with the branch name and new version
# After the hotfix ships, cherry-pick the fix to main via a separate PR
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create/Edit** the relevant files
2. **Test locally** against the running Docker stack
3. **Add bullets to `changes/<branch-name>.md`** (create if it doesn't exist — do NOT edit `CHANGES.md`)
4. **Commit** with descriptive messages

### Stacked PRs (preferred workflow)

Break features into a stack of small, focused PRs. Each step gets its own branch targeting the previous branch in the stack.

```bash
# First slice — targets main
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feature/foo-step-1
gh pr create --base main --title "step 1: ..."

# Second slice — stacked on top of step 1
git checkout -b feature/foo-step-2
gh pr create --base feature/foo-step-1 --title "step 2: ..."
```

When a bottom PR merges, retarget the next one: `gh pr edit <number> --base main`.

### Merging to Main

1. Open PR from `feature/<name>` or `bugfixes/<name>` into `main`
2. Use the fragment content from `changes/<branch-name>.md` as the PR description
3. Requires 1 approval — merge when CI passes
4. After merge: `bump-version.yml` increments Minor + timestamp; `docker-publish.yml` pushes `:edge`

### Cutting a Release

1. Go to **Actions → Cut Release → Run workflow**
2. Enter the version: `Major.Minor.Patch` (e.g. `5.2.0`)
3. The workflow creates tag `v5.2.0` on the current `main` HEAD
4. `docker-publish.yml` pushes `:latest` + `:5.2.0.0`

### Hotfix Releases

```bash
git checkout -b bugfixes/fix-foo v5.2.0
git push origin bugfixes/fix-foo
```

Then: **Actions → Cut Hotfix** with branch name and new version (e.g. `5.2.1`). Cherry-pick to `main` afterward.

## User Workflow (Getting Started)

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fortigi/IdentityAtlas/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
# Open http://localhost:3001 → Admin → Crawlers → Add Crawler
```
